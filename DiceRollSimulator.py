# Program by Trina Nixon

print("Welcome to my Dice Roll Simulator")

# assignment parameters are as follows:
# this program will simulate the rolling of two 6-sided dice
# a dictionary will keep track of the # of time that each total # is thrown
# dictionary values are as follows:
# key = sum of the 2 dice
# value = keep track of the # of rolls
# if key does not exist, set the value as 1
# if key does exist, add 1 to the value (like in dictionaries try it yourself assignment)

# allow user to choose how many times the dice will be thrown
# once dice thrown the specified number of times, print a histogram (using the * character) that shows the total percentage each number was rolled
# each * will represent 1% of the total rolls

# sample session:
# Welcome to the dice throwing simulator!
# How many dice rolls would you like to simulate? 1000

# DICE ROLLING SIMULATION RESULTS
# Each "*" represents 1 % of the total number of rolls.
# Total number of rolls = 1000.
