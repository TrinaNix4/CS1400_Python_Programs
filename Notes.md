# Big O

- measures how long an algorithm takes to run

- helps you write better code
- helps refactor bad or slow code

- scalability - will it work in production? will it work for end users?
- readability - is it clean? is it readable? is it modular? can other coders undertand it?

* when we talk about big O, we are talking about how scalable code is. if it's a good solution, it must be scalable
