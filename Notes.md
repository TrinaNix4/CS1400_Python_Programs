# Big O

- measures how long an algorithm takes to run

- helps you write better code
- helps refactor bad or slow code

- scalability - will it work in production? will it work for end users?
- readability - is it clean? is it readable? is it modular? can other coders undertand it?

* when we talk about big O, we are talking about how scalable code is. if it's a good solution, it must be scalable:
  - will it work in production?
  - will it handle a lot of data?
  - will it be fast?

- timing an algorithm has too much dependence on external factors (speed of computer, what code is used, etc), so not a fair way to determine how good the code is

- so to objectively say one algorithm is better than another...

* big O objectively measures how an algorithm scales
* scalability is directly related to input size and the number of operations as input size grows very large
